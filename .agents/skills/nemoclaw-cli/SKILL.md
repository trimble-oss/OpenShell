# NemoClaw CLI

Guide agents through using the `nemoclaw` CLI for sandbox and platform management -- from basic operations to advanced multi-step workflows.

## Overview

The NemoClaw CLI (`nemoclaw`) is the primary interface for managing sandboxes, providers, policies, inference routes, and gateways. This skill teaches agents how to orchestrate CLI commands for common and complex workflows.

**Companion skill**: For creating or modifying sandbox policy YAML content (network rules, L7 inspection, access presets), use the `generate-sandbox-policy` skill. This skill covers the CLI *commands* for the policy lifecycle; `generate-sandbox-policy` covers policy *content authoring*.

**Self-teaching**: The CLI has comprehensive built-in help. When you encounter a command or option not covered in this skill, walk the help tree:

```bash
nemoclaw --help                    # Top-level commands
nemoclaw <group> --help            # Subcommands in a group
nemoclaw <group> <cmd> --help      # Flags for a specific command
```

This is your primary fallback. Use it freely -- the CLI's help output is authoritative and always up-to-date.

## Prerequisites

- `nemoclaw` is on the PATH (install via `cargo install --path crates/navigator-cli`)
- Docker is running (required for gateway operations and BYOC)
- For remote clusters: SSH access to the target host

## Command Reference

See [cli-reference.md](cli-reference.md) for the full command tree with all flags and options. Use it as a quick-reference to avoid round-tripping through `--help` for common commands.

## Workflow 1: Getting Started

Use this workflow when no cluster exists yet and the user wants to get a sandbox running for the first time.

### Step 1: Bootstrap a cluster

```bash
nemoclaw gateway start
```

This provisions a local k3s cluster in Docker. The CLI will prompt interactively if a cluster already exists. The cluster is automatically set as the active gateway.

For remote deployment:

```bash
nemoclaw gateway start --remote user@host --ssh-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

### Step 2: Verify the cluster

```bash
nemoclaw status
```

Confirm the cluster is reachable and shows a version.

### Step 3: Create a sandbox

The simplest way to get a sandbox running:

```bash
nemoclaw sandbox create
```

This creates a sandbox with defaults and drops you into an interactive shell. The CLI auto-bootstraps a cluster if none exists.

**Shortcut for known tools**: When the trailing command is a recognized tool, the CLI auto-creates the required provider from local credentials:

```bash
nemoclaw sandbox create -- claude        # Auto-creates claude provider
nemoclaw sandbox create -- codex         # Auto-creates codex provider
```

The agent will be prompted interactively if credentials are missing.

### Step 4: Exit and clean up

Exit the sandbox shell (`exit` or Ctrl-D), then:

```bash
nemoclaw sandbox delete <name>
```

---

## Workflow 2: Provider Management

Providers supply credentials to sandboxes (API keys, tokens, etc.). Manage them before creating sandboxes that need them.

Supported types: `claude`, `opencode`, `codex`, `generic`, `nvidia`, `gitlab`, `github`, `outlook`.

### Create a provider from local credentials

```bash
nemoclaw provider create --name my-github --type github --from-existing
```

The `--from-existing` flag discovers credentials from local state (e.g., `gh auth` tokens, Claude config files).

### Create a provider with explicit credentials

```bash
nemoclaw provider create --name my-api --type generic \
  --credential API_KEY=sk-abc123 \
  --config base_url=https://api.example.com
```

Bare `KEY` (without `=VALUE`) reads the value from the environment variable of that name:

```bash
nemoclaw provider create --name my-api --type generic --credential API_KEY
```

### List, inspect, update, delete

```bash
nemoclaw provider list
nemoclaw provider get my-github
nemoclaw provider update my-github --type github --from-existing
nemoclaw provider delete my-github
```

---

## Workflow 3: Sandbox Lifecycle

### Create with options

```bash
nemoclaw sandbox create \
  --name my-sandbox \
  --provider my-github \
  --provider my-claude \
  --policy ./my-policy.yaml \
  --upload .:/sandbox \
  -- claude
```

Key flags:
- `--provider`: Attach one or more providers (repeatable)
- `--policy`: Custom policy YAML (otherwise uses built-in default or `NEMOCLAW_SANDBOX_POLICY` env var)
- `--upload <PATH>[:<DEST>]`: Upload local files into the sandbox (default dest: `/sandbox`)
- `--keep`: Keep sandbox alive after the command exits (useful for non-interactive commands)
- `--forward <PORT>`: Forward a local port (implies `--keep`)

### List and inspect sandboxes

```bash
nemoclaw sandbox list
nemoclaw sandbox get my-sandbox
```

### Connect to a running sandbox

```bash
nemoclaw sandbox connect my-sandbox
```

Opens an interactive SSH shell. To configure VS Code Remote-SSH:

```bash
nemoclaw sandbox ssh-config my-sandbox >> ~/.ssh/config
```

### Upload and download files

```bash
# Upload local files to sandbox
nemoclaw sandbox upload my-sandbox ./src /sandbox/src

# Download files from sandbox
nemoclaw sandbox download my-sandbox /sandbox/output ./local-output
```

### View logs

```bash
# Recent logs
nemoclaw logs my-sandbox

# Stream live logs
nemoclaw logs my-sandbox --tail

# Filter by source and level
nemoclaw logs my-sandbox --tail --source sandbox --level warn

# Logs from the last 5 minutes
nemoclaw logs my-sandbox --since 5m
```

### Delete sandboxes

```bash
nemoclaw sandbox delete my-sandbox
nemoclaw sandbox delete sandbox-1 sandbox-2 sandbox-3   # Multiple at once
```

---

## Workflow 4: Policy Iteration Loop

This is the most important multi-step workflow. It enables a tight feedback cycle where sandbox policy is refined based on observed activity.

**Key concept**: Policies have static fields (immutable after creation: `filesystem_policy`, `landlock`, `process`) and dynamic fields (hot-reloadable on a running sandbox: `network_policies`, `inference`). Only dynamic fields can be updated without recreating the sandbox.

```

        │                          │

        ▼                          │
  Verify reload succeeded ─────────┘
```

### Step 1: Create sandbox with initial policy

```bash
nemoclaw sandbox create --name dev --policy ./initial-policy.yaml --keep -- claude
```

Use `--keep` so the sandbox stays alive for iteration. The user can work in the sandbox via a separate shell.

### Step 2: Monitor logs for denied actions

In a separate terminal or as the agent:

```bash
nemoclaw logs dev --tail --source sandbox
```

Look for log lines with `action: deny` -- these indicate blocked network requests. The logs include:
- **Destination host and port** (what was blocked)
- **Binary path** (which process attempted the connection)
- **Deny reason** (why it was blocked)

### Step 3: Pull the current policy

```bash
nemoclaw policy get dev --full > current-policy.yaml
```

The `--full` flag outputs valid YAML that can be directly re-submitted. This is the round-trip format.

### Step 4: Modify the policy

Edit `current-policy.yaml` to allow the blocked actions. **For policy content authoring, delegate to the `generate-sandbox-policy` skill.** That skill handles:
- Network endpoint rule structure
- L4 vs L7 policy decisions
- Access presets (`read-only`, `read-write`, `full`)
- TLS termination configuration
- Enforcement modes (`audit` vs `enforce`)
- Binary matching patterns

Only `network_policies` and `inference` sections can be modified at runtime. If `filesystem_policy`, `landlock`, or `process` need changes, the sandbox must be recreated.

### Step 5: Push the updated policy

```bash
nemoclaw policy set dev --policy current-policy.yaml --wait
```

The `--wait` flag blocks until the sandbox confirms the policy is loaded (polls every second). Exit codes:
- **0**: Policy loaded successfully
- **1**: Policy load failed
- **124**: Timeout (default 60 seconds)

### Step 6: Verify the update

```bash
nemoclaw policy list dev
```

Check that the latest revision shows status `loaded`. If `failed`, check the error column for details.

### Step 7: Repeat

Return to Step 2. Continue monitoring logs and refining the policy until all required actions are allowed and no unnecessary permissions exist.

### Policy revision history

View all revisions to understand how the policy evolved:

```bash
nemoclaw policy list dev --limit 50
```

Fetch a specific historical revision:

```bash
nemoclaw policy get dev --rev 3 --full
```

---

## Workflow 5: BYOC (Bring Your Own Container)

Build a custom container image and run it as a sandbox.

### Step 1: Create a sandbox from a Dockerfile

```bash
nemoclaw sandbox create --from ./Dockerfile --keep --name my-app
```

The `--from` flag accepts a Dockerfile path, a directory containing a Dockerfile, a full image reference (e.g. `myregistry.com/img:tag`), or a community sandbox name (e.g. `openclaw`).

When given a Dockerfile or directory, the image is built locally via Docker and imported directly into the cluster's containerd runtime. No external registry needed.

When `--from` is specified, the CLI:
- Clears default `run_as_user`/`run_as_group` (custom images may not have the `sandbox` user)
- Uses a supervisor bootstrap pattern (init container copies the sandbox supervisor into a shared volume)

### Step 2: Forward ports (if the container runs a service)

```bash
# Foreground (blocks)
nemoclaw forward start 8080 my-app

# Background (returns immediately)
nemoclaw forward start 8080 my-app -d
```

The service is now reachable at `localhost:8080`.

### Step 3: Manage port forwards

```bash
# List active forwards
nemoclaw forward list

# Stop a forward
nemoclaw forward stop 8080 my-app
```

### Step 4: Iterate

To update the container:

```bash
nemoclaw sandbox delete my-app
nemoclaw sandbox create --from ./Dockerfile --keep --name my-app --forward 8080
```

### Shortcut: Create with port forward in one command

```bash
nemoclaw sandbox create --from ./Dockerfile --forward 8080 --keep -- ./start-server.sh
```

The `--forward` flag starts a background port forward before the command runs, so the service is reachable immediately.

### Limitations

- Distroless / `FROM scratch` images are not supported (the supervisor needs glibc, `/proc`, and a shell)
- Missing `iproute2` or required capabilities blocks startup in proxy mode

---

## Workflow 6: Agent-Assisted Sandbox Session

This workflow supports a human working in a sandbox while an agent monitors activity and refines the policy in parallel.

### Step 1: Create sandbox with providers and keep alive

```bash
nemoclaw sandbox create \
  --name work-session \
  --provider github \
  --provider claude \
  --policy ./dev-policy.yaml \
  --keep
```

### Step 2: User connects in a separate shell

Tell the user to run:

```bash
nemoclaw sandbox connect work-session
```

Or for VS Code:

```bash
nemoclaw sandbox ssh-config work-session >> ~/.ssh/config
# Then connect via VS Code Remote-SSH to the host "work-session"
```

### Step 3: Agent monitors logs

While the user works, monitor the sandbox logs:

```bash
nemoclaw logs work-session --tail --source sandbox --level warn
```

Watch for `deny` actions that indicate the user's work is being blocked by policy.

### Step 4: Agent refines policy

When denied actions are observed:

1. Pull current policy: `nemoclaw policy get work-session --full > policy.yaml`
2. Modify the policy to allow the blocked actions (use `generate-sandbox-policy` skill for content)
3. Push the update: `nemoclaw policy set work-session --policy policy.yaml --wait`
4. Verify: `nemoclaw policy list work-session`

The user does not need to disconnect -- policy updates are hot-reloaded within ~30 seconds (or immediately when using `--wait`, which polls for confirmation).

### Step 5: Clean up when done

```bash
nemoclaw sandbox delete work-session
```

---

## Workflow 7: Cluster Inference

Configure the cluster's managed inference route for `inference.local`.

### Set cluster inference

First ensure the provider record exists:

```bash
nemoclaw provider list
```

Then point cluster inference at that provider and model:

```bash
nemoclaw cluster inference set \
  --provider nvidia \
  --model nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b
```

This updates the cluster-managed `inference.local` route. There is no per-route create/list/update/delete workflow for sandbox inference.

### Inspect current inference config

```bash
nemoclaw cluster inference get
```

### How sandboxes use it

- Agents send HTTPS requests to `inference.local`.
- The sandbox intercepts those requests locally and routes them through the cluster inference config.
- Sandbox policy is separate from cluster inference configuration.

---

## Workflow 8: Gateway Management

### List and switch gateways

```bash
nemoclaw gateway select            # See all gateways (no args shows list)
nemoclaw gateway select my-cluster # Switch active gateway
nemoclaw status                    # Verify connectivity
```

### Lifecycle

```bash
nemoclaw gateway start                                 # Start local cluster
nemoclaw gateway stop                                  # Stop (preserves state)
nemoclaw gateway start                                 # Restart (reuses state)
nemoclaw gateway destroy                               # Destroy permanently
```

### Remote clusters

```bash
# Deploy to remote host
nemoclaw gateway start --remote user@host --ssh-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa --name remote-cluster

# Set up kubectl access
nemoclaw gateway tunnel --name remote-cluster

# Get cluster info
nemoclaw gateway info --name remote-cluster
```

---

## Self-Teaching via `--help`

When you encounter a command or option not covered in this skill:

1. **Start broad**: `nemoclaw --help` to see all command groups.
2. **Narrow down**: `nemoclaw <group> --help` to see subcommands (e.g., `nemoclaw sandbox --help`).
3. **Get specific**: `nemoclaw <group> <cmd> --help` for flags and usage (e.g., `nemoclaw sandbox create --help`).

The CLI help is always authoritative. If the help output contradicts this skill, follow the help output -- the CLI may have been updated since this skill was written.

### Example: discovering an unfamiliar command

```bash
$ nemoclaw sandbox --help
# Shows: create, get, list, delete, connect, upload, download, ssh-config, image

$ nemoclaw sandbox upload --help
# Shows: positional arguments (name, path, dest), usage examples
```
